## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap5](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
      * Used for version control.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
      * Used to store the code once pushed from Git. 


### What I learned

I learnt alot during the building of this project. First by adapting the masonary layout system to work with bootstrap5, which took quite a few tweeks.

[Link to Masonary system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/masonry/)

The building of the carousel/slider system was very tricky. I couldnt have an automatic slider and manual slider on the same page so I ended up building the on two different pages, whiched worked but wasnt exactly how I wanted it.

Also when building the project while using chrome developer tools it looked perfect on laptop, ipad and mobile, frustratingly however when i deployed the project and looked on mobile and ipad views on real devices there where some elements that where out. Going forward I want to up my skill in bootstrap5 using a mobile first aproach checking the whole time that it works correctly on all devices.

### Continued development

Continue to improve my Bootstrap5 skills.
I was going to practice using Json in this project but decided to concentrate on other things. I want to practice using Json in the next project


### Useful resources

- [Automatic Slider](https://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/zqVGQK) - This helped me build my own slider I really liked the way it worked and will use it going forward.
- [Manual Carousel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HcxHDS2w1s) - This is an amazing YouTube Vidio which helped me understand how to build a Carousel with images. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - A great webpage for someone beginning their journey with code.
- [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Another very useful site.
